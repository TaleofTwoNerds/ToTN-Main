		<h2 class="featurette-heading">Bio</h2>
		<p>In 2014 the Hacker got the idea that it would be interesting to make a web
		based blog for the perpose of being nerdy. This idea was talked about around 
		the family until he could gather enough support to start up a web blog. In 
		the beginning there were only two, hence the name Tale of Two Nerds, but as 
		time gathered on they gained resources and skills and became more than simply
		two nerds.</p>
		<p>Note: You do not get laid while making websites.</p>
		<p>As his skills grew he began to create more than just the ToTN blog, as 
		time went on he began to create his own websites (with a slight amount of
		help from Twitter's Bootstrap.) and create this wonderful example of a site 
		at taleoftwonerds.com</p>
